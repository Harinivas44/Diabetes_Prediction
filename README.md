# Project Overview

This project is all about predicting the likelihood of a person having diabetes based on certain health attributes. We've used a simple logistic regression model to make these predictions.
# Overview 📊

This project is all about predicting the likelihood of a person having diabetes based on certain health attributes. We've used a simple logistic regression model to make these predictions.

# Data 📈

The dataset used in this project contains information on various health attributes like pregnancy count (Preg), glucose concentration (Plas), blood pressure (Pres), skin thickness (skin), insulin test result (test), BMI (mass), diabetes pedigree function (pedi), and age (age). The dataset is divided into two classes: 0 (no diabetes) and 1 (diabetes).

# Model Training 🧠

I have split the dataset into a training set and a test set to train and evaluate our model. We used logistic regression, a commonly used algorithm for binary classification tasks, to create the model.

Model Evaluation 📉

I assessed the model's performance using several metrics:

* Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): A measure of the model's prediction accuracy.

* Accuracy Score: The proportion of correctly predicted instances.

* F1 Score: A metric that balances precision and recall for binary classification.

Results 📊

* RMSE: 0.4732

* Training Set Accuracy: 77.08%

* Test Set Accuracy: 77.60%

* F1 Score: 0.6504

* Conclusion 📝

This project demonstrates the use of a logistic regression model to predict diabetes based on health attributes. With an accuracy of approximately 77%, the model can provide valuable insights into the risk of diabetes for individuals.
